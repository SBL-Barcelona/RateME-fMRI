These are the scripts used in the study titled "When Group Grievances Become Personal: Dissociating the Neural Correlates of Group and Personal Discrimination". They are prepared for a data structure with a main folder containing a derivatives folder and a covariates folder. In the derivatives the scripts are prepared to read preprocessed data from a folder called fmriprep, and automatically create the folder structure for all the results. Finally, for the roi analisis an atlas is needed that can be found elsewhere (https://neurovault.org/images/395092/).
